Udacity projects in Ruby
========================

Udacity courses are pretty awesome, but are mostly in Python. I want to practice my Ruby skills too, so I'm creating a place where I can work through some of the example projects from Udacity courses in Ruby.

Because these are based on course examples, the implementation will reflect design choices made by the course instructors. Sometimes I will refactor code to be more to my liking, sometimes I won't.
